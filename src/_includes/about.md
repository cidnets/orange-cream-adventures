# Hello! 

## Welcome to Orange Cream Adventures!

I am a tiger made of boba and milkshakes residing in San Jose, California. This little site is a place for me to document my adventures around San Jose visiting places that are cooler than me and eating things more delicious than me.

Thank you for joining me on my adventures!
