Amazon Prime Pre-Premiere, filmed for IMAX (not in a true IMAX theatre):
- Great start, need to see it in a true IMAX theatre to properly compare
- Watching with other fans definitely heightened the experience for me. I think the energy of being with other people that were already invested in the character and the story before even seeing it was great. The guy next to me laughed, cried, and clapped at everything he was supposed to laugh, cry, and clap at. Someone down the row clapped everytime something got revealed. It was a great experience seeing this movie with other fans of Superman.
- Many easter eggs meant for hardcore fans of Superman. I definitely did not get them all, but the ones I did catch heightened the experience. I hope the kind of fans that would catch them all feel the same way.
- His arc was clear, story was symmetric. Loved how it starts and ends the same way. Genuine poetry.
- Soundtrack was great, as per usual with Gunn films. I did think it was weird that they reused Lex's theme for the Justice Gang towards the end of the movie. Or maybe I didn't catch that correctly and it's in fact a different song.
- Edi Gathegi was amazing as Mr. Terrific. He stole the show.
- All of the Justice Gang was fun, though. Isabela Merced played a great younger hero. And Nathan Fillion was great at convincing me to love an asshole. (He was so charming, it made it hard not to love him despite Guy being an asshole)
- Peacemaker cameo was so unexpected, it was hilarious.
- Love the sprinkling of Justice League stuff they threw in. The lead up to the Justice League will be great, I think.
- Nicholas Hoult was easily the best actor on the cast. He played Lex perfectly.
- We all know Gunn is a nerd, but I really felt like he GOT Superman. Superman's greatest strength is his humanity, and Lex Luthor's biggest gripe and flaw is his envy of metahumans. Especially Superman, because superman is both the greatest metahuman AND the embodiment of the best parts of humanity. It causes Lex to overlook and underestimate Superman, and it's his biggest downfall.
