# Summary of Exhibition

_Whitewashed_ discusses the role of language as part  of the human experience and its profound impact on our interpersonal connections. Verbal and written communication are easily our most important tools for expressing ourselves. However, what do we do when we do not have access to these pathways of communication? How do we ask for help? How do we form relationships? How do we navigate an incomprehensible world? When words become unavailable, we become isolated. 

Through the use of typographic abstraction, _Whitewashed_ offers insight into this experience. Within each piece exists a written language entirely inaccessible to the audience, symbolizing the enigmatic nature of language barriers. What is happening in this painting? What does it say? If only you could read it.

# Artist Statement

Verbal communication is paramount to our experiences as individuals. However, what do those experiences look like when your range with language is limited? The ability to use words is intrinsic to our identity, so how is that identity defined? “You’re not a real Filipino.” “Oh, so you’re like **whitewashed** whitewashed?” Because I do not speak Tagalog, I hear statements like these often. These assertions overtly invalidate my status as a Filipino American, fostering a perpetual ostracization within the community I was born into. Through  Whitewashed,  I  relive the experiences of unfamiliarity and isolation I’ve experienced due to not being bilingual. I am too American to be Filipino, but I am too Filipino to be American. 

Typographic abstraction serves as a sanctum for me to explore the intricacies of language and how it relates to my cultural identity. In this project, text is abstracted using a keyboard. Every line and loop corresponds to a word derived from gestures created when swipe typing. These individual gestures connect to form sentences, then paragraphs. Every painting amalgamates into a unique page of text, unreadable to everyone but myself. Interacting with these artworks thrusts the observer into a world where comprehension remains elusive, mirroring my experience with language barriers.
